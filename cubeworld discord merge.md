# CubeWorld discord merge
This is the idea of merging all cubeworld related discord servers to one big community to bring together everyone who currently plays cubeworld.
*Wait what? And how? Wouldn't that be extremely messy? Also the current owners don't want to loose the freedom and independence they currently have on their servers!*

Before I elaborate on that, let me give some general information about the current state of the CubeWorld community:
### currently there are 5 major communities:
| Name | Description | Link |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| [r/CubeWorld](http://reddit.com/r/cubeworld) | discord partners that don't host a server but maintain the largest community | discord.gg/cubeworld |
| [Zircon](http://Zircon.network) | network with both pvp (cuwo) and pve (vanilla) that uses a custom client for optimization | discord.gg/EU987J3 |
| [FoxDev](http://FoxDev.co) | currently the oldest and biggest pvp server running on cuwo | discord.gg/g5hhxRq |
| [Exceed](http://github.com/LastExceed/Exceed) | My project to create a lighting fast server with much less internet traffic/lag that uses a MITM for custom features | discord.gg/ZUwjxHf |
| [CubeWorld-servers.com](http://CubeWorld-servers.com) | The last server lister, also hosts a pvp server (cuwo) | discord.gg/6eF2g4p |

each one of these is completely independent at the moment. But this also means that
### The community is split
Some people don't even know about the existence of the other communites, thus thinking the still-active CubeWorld fandom is much smaller than it actually is, and also sometimes not knowing about game servers that are currently active. I have met people who thought there's only one server left alive although there's way more than that.

### Information doesn't spread to everyone
If something interesting happens in one community that isn't only related to that specific community but CubeWorld-general (eg the discovery of hidden features of the game. ChrisMiuchiz recently discovered a "teleport to town" hotkey, how many of you heard about that?), it takes forever until the others know about it. I keep meeting people who don't even know about Wollay's return after the 23 months of silence.

### How could we fix this?

By merging everyone to a single discord server. It might sound like that would cause a huge confusing mess, but let me explain how we'd go about this. Most important is that this entire plan only works out if all 5 communites agree.

### Restructure

First we need to decide on the destination server. In my eyes the answer to this quesiton is obvious: r/CubeWorld. And I don't say this because I'm moderating there (after all I am moderating the majority of these servers anyway) but for multiple other reasons:
- It's by far the biggest one at the moment
- They're discord partners and hold the fancy discord.gg/cubeworld invite link
- They don't host a server and are therefore the most neutral one in terms of who has how much power
- They have a dedicated bot developer that will come in handy when it comes to managing this huge community

In the end the current server owners will still have the same powers they currently have, the only difference being that there's more around it.
The key principle will be having roles for each community that the (players can assign themselves with the help of bots), eg @foxdev @exceed @zircon ect.
announcements won't be done with @everyone anymore but with the target communites role. If for example foxdev changes it's koth location the announcement will be done with @foxdev so that only those who are interested in foxdev's changes are pinged.
The same goes for bans, if a player is banned from a community then he will only loose access to that role and it's channels, but stay on the discord server (there will ofcourse also be server bans if i.e. someone posts cp/gore/idkwhat. Basically the admins of each server will keep any right they previously had on their own discord server inside their role, server wide administration privileges will be removed (except for Jay [the owner] and his team of course). This will make sure that if it ever happens that someone abuses his privileges the entire cubeworld community won't be completely fucked (unless it's jay himself lol). In real live politics this known as
> division of powers

Now what would the server look like? Obviously we can't just move all channels from all servers to a single one since that would be way too many and also very messy, so let's first get an overview of the typical channels you see on the discord servers:
- #welcome/#info/#rules
- #announcements
- #general
- #off-topic
- #botspam
- #logs
- #staff
- other channels

obviously we don't need multiple off-topic channels ect, I guess it'd be enough to share one of each of the following with all communities:
- #announcements
- #off-topic
- #botspam

the welcome/info/rules channel could be merged as well if structured properly (eg only show the basic rules, indept list of rules can be looked up with a bot command ect). Having a general info channel and one per community would be pretty much for read-only channels.

#general could be done in 2 ways: either one per community or one per cathegory (pvp/pve/...). both would be too much.

regarding the other channels: we need to spare a little in here, but that isn't that much of a problem since most other channels aren't visible by default anyway (eg #donator_lounge on foxdev & exceed). Same for #staff and #logs. Example: #looking-for-party might something useful for all communities although not all of have a similar channel yet, while #minecraft is something that does not belong here.

#### closing words
Thanks for reading my wall-of-text till the end. Obviously we don't have to do everything exactly the way I explained it in here, this is just 1 way we COULD do it to not loose the overview. Remember that this is just an idea, and everything is solely for the community. This is why this document will be sent to all server owners and after that to all communities where everyone can vote. Nothing will be done that the community doesn't want.
